# MSAccessâ€“HTML Parser (redacted)
A java program designed to sort loosely typed questions and answers into properly formatted semantic html
# Why is this a thing?
I intended to gather information from some educational institutions (>1000) regarding their policies towards a specific sub-group of students and gave a template for replies. However, I did not account that most people skip peripherals of emails and cut straight to answering questions or finding their course of action. Not just that, but many of the replies skipped some questions almost randomly. Because of this, I could not easily sort clean information into the pages and had to create a work-around to identify what were questions, what were answers and what was to be included in the web pages. This is that workaround.
